# Azure Database Migration

# Project Description
This project was split into 7 milestones. After each milestone, any relevant files were uploaded to this repository and this README was updated to document my progress.

## Milestone 1: Set up the Environment
In this milestone, this GitHub repo was created and I set up my account on Azure.

## Milestone 2: Set up the Production Environment
In this milestone, I provisioned a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) which was the cornerstone of my production environment. This VM hosted the company's database, serving as a secure, dedicated storage solution. SQL Server and Server Management Studio (SSMS) was installed on this VM to manage the database. 
- I provisioned a Windows 11 pro VM using the Standard B2ms storage size. This size is good for many workloads and so will be sufficient for this project.
- I connected securly to the newly created VM using the RDP protocol and installed SQL Server and SSMS
- After this, I created the company's database by restoring from a .bak backup file.

## Milestone 3: Migrate to Azure SQL Database

## Milestone 4: Data Backup and Restore
